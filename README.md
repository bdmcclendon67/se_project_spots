# Project 3: Spots

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

Hello world! My name is Benjamin McClendon, a software engineering student at TripleTen.This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. As an engineer, I have learned that accessibility is important to ensure that everyone has access to your content.

**Technology Used**

-HTML
-CSS
-Responsive Design

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma — we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

The first step is to start building the foundation with HTML code. This is where the website's skeletal structure is created. Everything, including text, buttons, images, etc., are added here and prepared to be positioned and styled properly using CSS.

This is the profile section I designed using code that was replicated from Figma.

This is the desktop view for the Spots project. In order to achieve this, I gained a solid understanding of grid positioning, proper use of margins and padding, and flexbox positioning.
